### Light In The Dark

This is an interactive scene created for iHart. This application implements a finding game.

#### Files included
* various __*.as__ files - the application source code
* __LightAndDark.fla__ - the application gui
* __LightAndDark.swf__, __LightAndDark.app__, __LightAndDark.exe__ - the exported application
* __README.md__

#### How to run the application  
1. Make sure that the iHart program is running on your computer.
2. Check that the camera is working and that you have specified an appropriate interest area.
2. Make sure to enable faces (by sliding the "enable faces" trackbar to the right in the settings panel of the server). This application works with faces.
3. To run the application open the LightAndDark.swf file.
4. As you move in front of the camera, you should see a loading screen, and then a "light" that follows a face around.

If the LightAndDark.swf file is not working, you might need to re-export the application, or try with the .app or .exe versions (on OS X or Windows respectively).
