# Applications

This folder contains iHart applications. Most of them contain runnable applications of the form `APP.swf`, `APP.exe`, or `APP.app`. The `exe` file works on Windows, the `app` file works on OS X, and the `swf` works on both. The `swf` requires that you have Flash Player, but the other versions should work alone.

## Running an application

1. Run the iHart server first. The server can be run by going to the `server/dist/` folder, then choosing which operating system you are on to run the appropriate version. Click on the server file to run it, and slide the "start" slider to the right to begin.
1. Choose which app you would like to run. Go into that app's folder and click on the application file. A window containing that application should appear.

Note: Some applications have a few extra steps or special requirements. Check that application's documentation for specifics.
