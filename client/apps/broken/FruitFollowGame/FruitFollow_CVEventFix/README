### FruitFollowFriend

This is an interactive scene created for iHart. This application has a sequence of fruits that "light up" and the player 
needs to pick the fruits in the same order using hand gestures. If the sequence chosen is right, the player moves up a level and
the sequence of fruit is increased. There are 4 frutis from which the app can choose the fruits for the player to "follow".

#### How to run the application  
1. Make sure that the iHart program is running on your computer.
2. Check that the camera is working and that you have specified an appropriate interest area.
3. To run the application open the FruitFollowFun.swf file.
4. As you move in front of the camera, instruction screen will appear then disappear in a few seconds. Once the application picks
what fruit to follow, use your hand to pick the same frutis in the same sequence. There is a tiny mouse hand cursor on the screen 
that shows exactly where your motion is being detected
