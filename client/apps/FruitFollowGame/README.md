### FruitFollowFriend

This is an interactive scene created for iHart. This application has a sequence of fruits that "light up" and the player needs to pick the fruits in the same order using hand gestures. If the sequence chosen is right, the player moves up a level and the sequence of fruit is increased. There are 4 frutis from which the app can choose the fruits for the player to "follow".
