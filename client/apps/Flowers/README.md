#### How to run the application  
1. Make sure that the iHart program is running on your computer.
2. Check that the camera is working and that you have specified an appropriate interest area.
3. To run the application open the Flowers.swf file.
4. As you move in front of the camera, you should see flowers appearing along the path of your movement.
