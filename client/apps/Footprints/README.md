### Footprints

This is an interactive scene created for iHart. This application has a beach background and is meant to be displayed on the floor via a projector. Once movement (eg, by people walking) is detected, footprints are printed on the sand to give a footprints-in-the-sand beach-y feel. 


#### Files included
* __PaintingCV.as__ - main file for motion detection
* __PaintingCV.fla__ - the application gui
* __PaintingCV.swf__, __PaintingCV.app__, __PaintingCV.exe__ - the exported application
* __README.md__


#### How to run the application  
1. Make sure that the iHart program is running on your computer.
2. Check that the camera is working and that you have specified an appropriate interest area.
3. To run the application open the Painting.swf file.
4. As you move in front of the application, footprints will be placed onto the sand background
