### PaintFootPrints

This is an interactive scene created for iHart. This application has a beach background and is meant to be display on the floor
than the monitor. Once movement (preferably by people walking) is detected, footprints are printed on the sand to give a 
footprints-in-the-sand beachy feel. 


#### Files included
* Painting.as - main file for motion detection
* Painting.fla__ - the application gui
* Painting.swf__ - the exported application
*README.md__


#### How to run the application  
1. Make sure that the iHart program is running on your computer.
2. Check that the camera is working and that you have specified an appropriate interest area.
3. To run the application open the Painting.swf file.
4. As you step onto the application (which will preferably be shown on the ground), footprints will be placed onto the sand 
background

*author: Barsha Shrestha '15, Miriam '18, Yavneeka Patel '17   
 

#### Bugs
* Multiple footprints get painted on the same area. Working on fix.

#### Ideas for improvement
* Screensaver letting the user know what the app is about. Also asking the user to how they plan to walk (from left bottom corner 
right, from bottom to top etc) so the footprints that get printed on the sand match the angle they are making with their actual
foot.
