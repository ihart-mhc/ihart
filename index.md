### Welcome to the iHart GitHub Page!

The iHart: Interactive Hallways for Attraction and Retention in Technology project provides inexperienced programmers with the unique opportunity to develop interactive scenes and games that can be displayed on floors and walls, creating a fun and refreshing diversion from the hustle of everyday life for anyone who walks by. The project strengths lie in its intuitive development environment and its easy and inexpensive installation into the hallway. The goal of the iHart project is to attract and inspire students to pursue careers in computer science and information technology.

Setting up an iHart display takes two steps: running the server, then running a client application. Your computer should have a webcam available.

1. To run the iHart server software go to where you downloaded the project. Navigate to **server --> dist**, then go to either **mac** or **windows** depending on your operating system. Run the program called **cvServer**.
1. Next, return to the main iHart folder and go to **client --> apps**. Choose an application, and check out how to run applications on the [applications page](/applications).
